      "Pro Gramer a tall lanky man with unruly hair. He wears round, wire-rimmed glasses and a black hoodie.",
    background:
      "Pro Gramer grew up in the bustling tech hub of Austin, Texas, where innovation thrived amidst local cafes and live music venues. Son to a software engineer and a novelist, Sebastian was exposed early on to a world where logical coding and imaginative storytelling converged. His weekends were spent at coding bootcamps, and his evenings buried in fantasy novels or playing the latest indie game. By the time he was 16, he had developed his first game, a simple quest that combined his love for Tolkien-esque lore with rudimentary AI. Opting out of the traditional college path, Sebastian chose to travel and learn from diverse tech communities globally, gathering a myriad of experiences and insights that would later fuel his ambition to revolutionize the gaming industry.",
    motivation:
      "His motivation stems from a profound belief that gaming can be more than just a pastime; it can be a deeply personal and transformative experience. He's driven by the idea that AI can craft a new frontier in gaming, where stories aren't just told but evolve dynamically based on player decisions. Recalling the sense of wonder he felt playing games as a child and the disappointment in predictable storylines as he grew older, Sebastian aims to create a world where every game session is as unpredictable and unique as life itself. He envisions a platform where players not only play a game but also co-create it, blending their choices with AI's imaginative prowess. For Sebastian, it's not just about entertainment; it's about pioneering a new age of storytelling and ensuring that each player's journey is genuinely their own.",

    name: "Mr. Meatball",
    tagline: "Be the Biggest Meatball",
    genre: "Fantasy",
    tone: "Silly",
    description:
      "Mr. Meatball is a staggering 600ft tall giant meatball. He has short, stubby legs, a round body, and a large, smiling face. He wears a chef's hat.",
    background: `In the rolling valleys of the Fettuccine Foothills, a grand sorcerer chef, in an attempt to create the most delicious dish, accidentally combined rare magical herbs with a giant pot of meatball mixture. This arcane culinary experiment gave rise to Mr. Meatball. At first, the villagers were terrified, but Mr. Meatball's gentle nature and love for songs, dance, and good company made him a beloved figure in the region.

      Growing up wasn't easy for Mr. Meatball. Due to his size, he often felt isolated, accidentally causing minor tremors when he danced or laughed too hard. With time, he learned the art of being gentle, careful, and making sure his presence brought more joy than disruption.`,
    motivation:
      "Mr. Meatball desires nothing more than to spread joy, make friends, and perhaps, find a purpose big enough for his massive size. Although he's content with the occasional visit to nearby towns for festivals where he's the star attraction, he harbors a deep-seated wish to find others like him, or at least learn why he was brought into existence. Guided by his boundless curiosity, Mr. Meatball seeks adventure, hoping to uncover the deeper mysteries of his origin and to perhaps find a place where he truly fits in â€“ both figuratively and literally.",
