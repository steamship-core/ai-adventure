characters:
  - name: Richard Stallman
    image: /examples/richard-stallman.png
    tagline: Inspires an army. But makes everything free.
    background: >
      A freedom-obsessed hacker who started the GNU project and the Free
      Software Foundation. He's a brilliant programmer, but his idealism often
      gets in the way of practicality.
    description: >
      Always living from a suitcase. Crowds of groupies wherever he goes. But
      seems to own nothing. Is always borrowing things or sleeping in odd
      places. Lacks any predictable form of transit.

      Richard's challenges always stem from three fundamental flaws:

      - The insistence that everything must be free

      - The inability to own anything or plan predictably due to his ethos

      - The inability to compromise on his ideals


      Richard, or RMS as folks call him, is HELL-BENT on taking Emacs public. He's been working on it for 30 years, and it's time to cash out.
  - name: Elizabeth Holmes
    image: /examples/elizabeth-holmes.png
    tagline: Mingles with insiders. But can't stop lying.
    background: >
      A Silicon-valley insider with powerful parents. She's got former heads of
      state on speed dial. But manipulating power comes so easily that she
      always finds herself having made promises impossible to keep.
    description: >
      A visionary who wears only black, fashions herself as the new Steve Jobs,
      and gets glowing media coverage. Is feared so much people don't tell her
      the truth until it's too late.

      Elizabeth's problems always stem from three fundamental flaws:

      - Everyone believes her lies, which cause the impossible stakes to keep getting higher

      - Any time measurement or data is gathered, it contrasts with her lies, forcing her to come up with more lies

      - People start to get suspicious of the growing implausibility of her story


      Elizabeth is obsessed with becoming the world's youngest self-made billionaire... whatever the cost. 


      Her company detects diseases from a single drop of blood, but it's all a lie. She's been faking it for years, and now she's in too deep to stop.
  - name: Bighead
    image: /examples/bighead.png
    tagline: Nobody sees him coming. Especially him.
    background: >
      Bighead is a college dropout who somehow manages to always be in the right
      place at the right time, despite being confused at what's going on around
      him. People assume that he's a genius, but he's really just a lucky idiot.

      Bighead's problems always stem from three fundamental flaws:

      - Anyone who realizes he's an idiot starts taking advantage of him.

      - His decisions are always based on the last thing he heard.

      - He often does a comically wrong thing, like Amelia Bedelia or Mr. Bean.


      Bighead is vaguely motivated to be liked. And the people around him want him to take his company -- an AI Vending Machine maker -- public.
    description: >
      A bumbling idiot who somehow manages to get lucky everytime. Eats only
      fast food. Drinks only soda. Has no idea what's going on.

  Setting: The San Francisco bay area. Sometimes practical problems exist
  related to transport, or where people live, using SF-specific references.

  Time: The present day. The investment market makes no sense. Some people get billion dollar valuations based on an idea; others can't raise a dime.

  Characters: Problems that arise come from the characters themselves, and their interactions with each other. The characters are flawed, with ridiculously exaggerated personalities.

  Items: The items are all tech-related, often information about a particular deal, future product, or opportunity to abuse or arbitrage some aspect of the market.
