## Deployment

**Important!** After your initial deployment, you'll need to [configure your database](#configure-postgres)

Once you have access to [the environment variables you'll need](#set-up-environment-variables), deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/steamship-core/ai-adventure/tree/main&project-name=ai-adventure&repository-name=ai-adventure&env=CLERK_SECRET_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL,STEAMSHIP_API_KEY)

## Set up Environment Variables

### Configure Clerk

1. Create an account with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Set the following env vars in Vercel

```
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

### Configure Steamship

1. Create an account with [Steamship](https://steamship.com/)
2. Get your API Key [here](https://www.steamship.com/account/api)
3. Set the following env vars in Vercel:

```
STEAMSHIP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Configure PostGres

1. From Vercel, open your new project and select the "Storage" tab
2. Create a new postgres database
3. The environment variables should be automatically set now within vercel. You can verify this by navigating to project settings > environmental variables > looking for postgres related env vars.

More on setting up your database can be found here: https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart.

### Configure PostGres Tables

We use prisma to manage database updates, and @vercel/postgres for running queries

1. Install the vercel cli `npm i -g vercel`
2. Install repo dependencies `npm i`
3. Connect to Vercel `vercel link`. Follow the prompts to connect to the project you just created
4. Generate the prisma types: `npx prisma generate`

To update the production DB:

1. `vercel pull --environment=production`
2. Create the tables in the DB: `npm run prod:db-push`

TO update the development DB:

1. `vercel pull --environment=development`
2. Create the tables in the DB: `npm run dev:db-push`

### Finally: Redeploy your Application

After configuring your production database. Make sure to re-deploy your project.

You can do that by navigating to your project in Vercel and clicking the redeploy option.

### Optional: Configure Stripe

The game gives each user monthly free "Energy" to quest with, and offers paid plans to get more.

Get a Stripe API Key at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and then set the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` - The Price ID of your monthly subscription plan
- `STRIPE_TOPUP_PRICE_ID` - The Price ID of your one-time top-up item
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - The Webhook secret for Stripe Events
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE_URL` - The base URL of your deployment, without a trailing slash

If you don't set up Stripe, the game will still work, but players will have no way to add energy once it is depleted.

### Optional: Configure Axiom (Logging)

This game uses Axiom for cloud logging.

Get an Axiom API Key at [axiom.co](https://axiom.co) and then set the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AXIOM_TOKEN` - Your public Axiom token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AXIOM_DATASET` - Your Axiom logging dataset

### Optional: Configure Vercel Analytics

This game uses Vercel Analytics for user tracking.

Get a Vercel Analytics ID from your Vercel project page, and then set the following environment variables:

- `VERCEL_WEB_ANALYTICS_ID` - Your Vercel Analytics ID

## Running on Localhost

To run on localhost:

Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Make sure your `.env.local` file is set:

TODO(ted) - what's best practice for this?

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customization

### Customizing the Non-Generative Game UI

The non-generative portions of the Game UI are all contained within this NextJS project.

You can start exploring by looking at the pages in `app/pages`.
When running on localhost, your browser will update automatically when you edit and save a file.

### Customizing Generated Images

TODO: Document `configuration/`

## Advanced Customization

The generative game engine is a [separate open-source project](https://github.com/steamship-core/ai-adventure-agent) deployed to [Steamship](https://steamship.com). It maintains most of the game state -- this web app is mostly a headless client.

By default, this Vercel project is configured to use Steamship's [officially supported version of the game engine](https://steamship.com/packages/ai-adventure).

If the modifications you with to make are beyond the provided settings of the official engine, you can easily fork, change, deploy, and use your own. Just follow these steps:

1. Fork the [game engine repository](https://github.com/steamship-core/ai-adventure-agent)
2. Make any modifications you wish.
3. Deploy it as your own Steamship package (`ship deploy`)
4. Change the `STEAMSHIP_AGENT_VERSION` environment variable in this Vercel project to match your own game engine's handle. If you want to pin it to a specific version, use `handle@version` format.

> [!NOTE]  
> This agent is under **very actively** development. We suggest focusing your changes on `quest_agent.py`
> Please join our [our discord](https://steamship.com/discord) to build-test with us!
