        3. Pricing, Subscriptions, Free Trials, and Individual Offerings
      </h3>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">3.1. Pricing</h4>
      <p>
        Steamship may offer the Services on a subscription basis or based on
        usage as further set forth on our website or as we may otherwise
        communicate to you in writing. The Services may also permit you to
        purchase certain plugins, packages or other software tools or products,
        including products or services of third parties that are offered through
        the Services (“Offerings”).
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">3.2. Subscription and Usage-based Payments</h4>
      <p>
        You agree to pay us applicable fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars. You agree
        that (a) if you purchase a recurring subscription to any of the Services
        or sign up to pay for the Services based on usage, we may store and
        continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card), and (b) we may
        calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you
        provide us at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to change our
        pricing models or adjust pricing for the Services in any manner and at
        any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except
        as otherwise provided in these Terms, any price changes or changes to
        your subscription or usage-based plan will take effect following
        reasonable notice to you. All subscriptions and usage-based fees are
        payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the
        subscription or fees for use becomes payable. Subscriptions will not be
        processed until payment has been received in full, and any holds on your
        account by any other payment processor are solely your responsibility.
        Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, payments for any
        subscriptions to the Services and for any usage-based fees are
        nonrefundable and there are no credits for partially used periods or
        credits. Following any cancellation by you, however, you will continue
        to have access to the paid Services through the end of the subscription
        period for which payment has already been made or until any usage-based
        credits have be used, as applicable.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">3.3. Subscription Renewals and Cancellations</h4>
      <p>
        You agree that if you purchase a subscription, your subscription will
        automatically renew at the subscription period frequency referenced on
        your subscription page (or if not designated, then monthly) and at the
        then-current rates, and your payment method will automatically be
        charged at the start of each new subscription period for the fees and
        taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future subscription charges,
        you must cancel your subscription 1 days before the subscription period
        renewal date by doing the following: visit your{" "}
        <Link href="/account/plan">Plan Settings</Link> and select
        &quot;Cancel&quot;.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">3.4. Free Trials</h4>
      <p>
        You can sign up for a trial Account for the paid portion of the Services
        and your trial period starts on the day you create the trial Account and
        lasts for the duration indicated on your free trial confirmation email
        or until you reach the quota indicated on your free trial confirmation
        email. If you are on a trial, you may cancel at any time until the last
        day of your trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in
        Section 3.3 above. If you do not cancel your trial Account at the end of
        your free trial period, and we have notified you that your Account will
        be converted to a paid subscription at the end of the free trial period,
        you authorize us to charge your credit card or other designated billing
        method for continued use of the paid Services. You may, however, then
        cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 3.3 of these Terms.
        If you cancel your trial Account or decide not to purchase a paid
        version of the Services at the end of your trial period, your content or
        data associated with your trial Account will no longer be available to
        you, and Steamship may delete or remove any such content or data.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">3.5. Payment for Individual Offerings</h4>
      <p>
        We reserve the right, with or without prior notice and in our sole and
        complete discretion, to (a) discontinue, modify, or limit the available
        quantity of, any Offerings, and (b) refuse to allow any user to purchase
        any Offering or deliver such Offerings to a user or a user designated
        address. When you purchase Offerings, you (a) agree to pay the price for
        such Offerings as set forth on our website, and all shipping and
        handling charges and all applicable taxes in connection with your
        purchase (the “Full Purchase Amount”), and (b) authorize us to charge
        your credit card or other payment method for the Full Purchase Amount.
        You acknowledge and agree that all information you provide with regards
        to a purchase of Offerings is accurate, current and complete. You
        represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use the payment
        method you provide to us or our payment processor, including, without
        limitation, any credit card you provide when completing a transaction.
        Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. Dollars. All
        fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect
        at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable.

        certain rights in software packages and plugins made such users (each, a
        “Developer”) directly from such Developer (such functionality, the
        “Marketplace”). You may act as a Developer or Licensee. The Developer
        will set all prices and the license terms for its software packages and
        plugins made available via the Marketplace (the “Developer IP”). When
        you purchase Developer IP, you (a) agree to pay the price for such
        Developer IP as set forth in the Marketplace, including all applicable
        taxes in connection with your purchase, and (b) authorize us to charge
        your payment method for such amount. Such amounts will be processed by
        our third party payment processor service providers. Steamship will make
        such amounts available to Developer in due course. Your use of any
        Developer IP is subject to the terms between you and that Developer, and
        Steamship is not responsible for any liability arising from your use of
        the Developer software.

        12. Arbitration and Class Waiver
      </h3>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
        LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO
        HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY
        BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">12.2. Informal Process First</h4>
      <p>
        You and Steamship agree that in the event of any dispute, either party
        will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained
        effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of
        resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first
        allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond. Both you and
        Steamship agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition
        precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration
        against the other party.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">
        12.3. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver
      </h4>
      <p>
        After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute,
        controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to
        Steamship’s services and/or products, including the Services, and any
        use or access or lack of access thereto, will be resolved by
        arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the
        Claim. You and Steamship agree that any Claim will be settled by final
        and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by
        JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS
        Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by
        reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Because
        your contract with Steamship, these Terms, and this Arbitration
        Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act
        (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the
        arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA
        and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to
        suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance
        with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in
        any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will
        take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions
        are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you
        and Steamship are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to
        participate in a class action or class arbitration.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">12.4. Exceptions.</h4>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Steamship agree that the
        following types of disputes will be resolved in a court of proper
        jurisdiction:
      </p>
      <div className="ml-5 space-y-6">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">(a)</span> disputes or claims within the
          jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the
          jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is
          brought and maintained as an individual dispute and not as a class,
          representative, or consolidated action or proceeding;
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">(b)</span> disputes or claims where the
          sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public
          injunctive relief); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">(c)</span> intellectual property disputes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">12.5. Costs of Arbitration</h4>
      <p>
        Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses
        will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that
        any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be
        prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, Steamship will pay
        the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines
        are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more
        expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as
        set forth below). Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to
        applicable law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
        your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought
        for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
        Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees
        will be governed by the JAMS rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
        Steamship for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise
        your obligation to pay under the applicable rules. If you prevail in the
        arbitration and are awarded an amount that is less than the last written
        settlement amount offered by Steamship before the arbitrator was
        appointed, Steamship will pay you the amount it offered in settlement.
        The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
        and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
        and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
        arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">12.6. Opt-Out</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration
        provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your
        decision to opt-out to{" "}
        <Link href="mailto:opt-out@steamship.com">opt-out@steamship.com</Link>{" "}
        or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section
        of these Terms. The notice must be sent to Steamship within 30 days of
        your first registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms;
        otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis
        in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration
        provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action
        waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action
        waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. If you opt-out of these
        arbitration provisions, Steamship also will not be bound by them.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-2xl">
        12.7. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.
      </h4>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Steamship
        each agree that any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim, or
        controversy will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS),
        CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING
        (“CLASS ACTION”). You and Steamship AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
        PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. You and
        Steamship EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY
        FORUM. If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT
        HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS
        ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE
        ARBITRATION. Further, you and Steamship agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY
        NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT
        MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. For the
        avoidance of doubt, however, you can seek public injunctive relief to
        the extent authorized by law and consistent with the Exceptions clause
        above. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND
        UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
        PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO
        SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A
        CLASS ACTION. If a court decides that the limitations of this paragraph
        are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private
        attorney general, or consolidated or representative action must be
        brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.

        Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as
        may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of
        the Services after the modifications have become effective will be
        deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms. No amendment shall apply

        suspend, disable, or delete your Account and/or the Services (or any

        termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect
